	* Values on which grouping is performed are displayed in the output as row titles. If grouping is performed on two or more fields, their values are separated by a question mark in the row title.
		For example, consider a selector that contains the expressions HTTP.REQ.URL and CLIENT.IP.SRC (in that order), on an appliance that has accumulated records of a number of requests for two URLs, example.com/page1.html and example.com/page2.html, from two client IP addresses, 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11. 
		With a pattern of ? ?, the appliance performs grouping on both fields and displays statistics for the following:
		* Requests for example.com/abc.html from 192.0.2.10, with a row title of example.com/abc.html?192.0.2.10.
		* Requests for example.com/abc.html from 192.0.2.11, with a row title of example.com/abc.html?192.0.2.11.
		* Requests for example.com/def.html from 192.0.2.10, with a row title of example.com/def.html?192.0.2.10.
		* Requests for example.com/def.html from 192.0.2.11, with a row title of example.com/def.html?192.0.2.11.
		With a pattern of * ?, the appliance performs grouping on only the client IP address values and displays statistics for the following requests:
		* All requests from 192.0.2.10, with the IP address as the row title.
		* All requests from 192.0.2.11, with the IP address as the row title.
		With a pattern of ? *, the appliance performs grouping on only the URL values and displays statistics for the following requests:
		* All requests for example.com/abc.html, with the URL as the row title.
		* All requests for example.com/def.html, with the URL as the row title.
		With a pattern of * *, the appliance displays one set of collective statistics for all the requests received, with no row title.
		With a pattern of example.com/abc.html ?, the appliance displays statistics for requests for example.com/abc.html from each unique client IP address.
		With a pattern of * 192.0.2.11, the appliance displays statistics for all requests from 192.0.2.11.
